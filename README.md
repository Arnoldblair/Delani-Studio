## Description
* Delani studio is a recreated landing page of a fictional studio. The aim is to use jQuery to increase interactivity of the page.

## PROJECT BEHAVIOUR

* The 'What we do' icons when clicked should toggle between the respective description of each icon.   
* The description should be centered aligned. The header should be in bold and centered also. This should be achieved by using jQuery.
* There should be a Hover effect for the Portfolio sections such that on hover a white box appears with then name of the project inside. The project picture should still be visible in the background. This should be achieved using jQuery.
   * The site should be responsive.
  *  The user should know through a pop up that their message has been received. For example: "Hi Arnold, we have received your message. Thank you for reaching out to us."
